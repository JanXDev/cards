This is an exercise for react. 


Here are the steps: 


- Create a card component
- Create the JSX Structure of the card (Testing the rendering without any dynamic props)
- Start implementing dynamic props to the component
- Inserting props from the parent component
- Creating a state variable for the theme in the parent
- Passing the state variable as a prop in my child component
- Make my child component react to that prop (if white then backgournd white else background black)
- Create a button in the parent, that will update that state variable
- Create an array, to basically create a map of multiple cards ( state variable )
- Display a placheolder for 2 seconds before the card gets displayed ( useEffect )
